                <ul>
                    <li>The gray whale is the only living member of the baleen whale family Eschrichtiidae. The gray whale differs from the other two baleen whale families primarily 
                        in its feeding behavior, it is a bottom feeder.</li>
                    <li>Gray whales earned the nickname "devil fish" because of their aggressive reactions when harpooned.</li>
                    <li>Gray whales are predominantly bottom feeders and forage along the ocean floor. Turning on its side, a gray whale gulps great mouthfuls of silt, strains out water
                        and mud through its baleen, and swallos bottom-dwelling invertebrates. This whale species has the least amount of baleen, approximately 130 baleen strips on each
                        side of jaw. The reduced number of baleen reflects the fact that they are bottom feeders.</li>
                    <li>Females give birth to 4.9 m (16 ft.) calves in the warm, shallow lagoons of Baja. While in the lagoons, some gray whales are unusually receptive to the presence
                        of humans.</li>
                    <li>They are believed to be able to dive up to 120 m (395 ft.) and swim up to 15 kph (33 mph).</li>
                    <li>Gray whales are known to migrate more than 10,000 km (6,000 miles) each way. That's the longest known migration route of any mammal.</li>
                </ul>
